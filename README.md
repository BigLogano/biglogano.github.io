Notepad App:
A little app where you can jot down notes, save them online, and mess around with them whenever you want.


What it does:
Type in a title and some notes.

Hit submit, and boom — it saves your note online.

See all your saved notes listed below.

Click Load to bring a note back into the form if you wanna tweak it.

Click Delete if you wanna toss a note out.


Tech stuff:
Plain old JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Supabase handles the backend/database stuff so I don’t have to mess with anything else


Why I made it:
Just wanted a quick, fun project to connect a simple frontend with a real backend. Supabase made it super easy to get this going without stress.


What I learned:
How to talk to a database from JavaScript.

Handling forms and updating the page without refreshing.

Doing basic stuff like add, read, and delete notes in a web app.

Keeping it simple and working.
